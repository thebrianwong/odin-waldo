# Where's That Pokemon?

In this game, players are provided 3 levels to choose from.

In each level, 3 specific Pokemon must be found among the hundreds of Pokemon in each level's image.

When players think they found a Pokemon, they can click on the image and choose from the list of 3 specific Pokemon.

Upon finding all 3 Pokemon, players are able to submit their time scores, names, and favorite Pokemon to the leaderboard.

Try to get the quickest time in all 3 levels!

This project was originally written with JavaScript and CSS, then converted to TypeScript and SASS/SCSS.

Additionally, it was originally deployed using Firebase, then converted to using an Express backend with MongoDB deployed on Render.

The backend has since then been moved to a serverless backend running on AWS API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB. The app is still hosted on Render.

It can be found and played [here](https://waldo-frontend.onrender.com/).
